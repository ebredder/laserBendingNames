# laserBendingNames
Simple nameplates using a laser cutter and some thin kerf cuts in wood to create radius.

The main objective of this project is to share some bending techniques with flat materials using the laser cutter as the primary means of manufacturing. This short project is meant as an introductory activity that creates conversation around material properties and flexibility of manufacturing processes. This project can we customized with names, materials, paint/finishes and can be sanded to clean laser burn marks. The final assembly can be dry fit and then glued permanently.

The design is fairly simple in terms of kerf cutting patterns to show the ease of design, but achieve higher form than straight angles. The current design is bent at a 60 degree angle from the surface it sits on. The sketch for the holders shows the process in determining the radius curve based on the circumference of the circle and length of the kerf-bent area.

No project comes with a variety of prototypes!
